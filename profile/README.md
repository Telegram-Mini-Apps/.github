# Telegram Mini Apps

This GitHub organization aims at improving the developer experience for the Telegram Mini Apps platform.
It provides complete documentation, templates, and a wide range of packages for various programming languages.

## Motivation

### Single source

One of the purposes of this organization is to provide a single source of information for the platform,
significantly decreasing the barrier for entry. Telegram's documentation can sometimes be difficult to
research and find the specific information that developers need. This is the reason why community needs
this kind of organization.

### Public development

The other idea behind the organization is to make platform development public. Developers would like to
see what is going on behind the scenes or at least know what is going to be implemented in near future.
This is rather rare feature for big companies, but we believe that Telegram is able to help with this.

Everything provided by the organization is the result of hard work and is available for free to everyone.

## Issues and Enhancements

Organization provides a special repository to report a bug or suggest a
platform enhancement. Nevertheless, it is appreciated not only to report a bug
in this organization, but to go further and refer to it in the Telegram applications
repositories related to the reported problem.

## Boilerplates

[tmajs-docs]: https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/typescript/tma-js-sdk/about

The boilerplates mentioned in this section are [@tma.js][https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/tma-js-sdk]-based. They don't use the SDK provided by Telegram,
but it's a better alternative. Also, almost all boilerplates in this section utilize such frontend tool
as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). This bundler is recognized as a good alternative for such technology
as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Design System

Community developed a design component library in Figma, which will make it easier for designers to design apps for
Telegram Mini Apps. The components fully mimic the Telegram interface, use it as a foundation, and inherit all
existing principles. Libraries are available iOS, Android and other platforms.
